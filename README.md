### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm trying to develop humanity's tech tree, and am currently focused on developing next generation intelligent systems and applying them. Some highlights:

â€£ AI Research Scientist and Faculty Member at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  I co-lead a few initiatives at the AI-ALOE Institute & the Design and Intelligence Lab, and lead the Manifold Research Group.

â€£ Founded Galactic Technologies, a startup studio focused on extending the impact of this and other research in the most value generative way possible. We're currently building Luminary, Autopilot for Digital Work.

â€£ Amateur Explorer pursuing different adventures - exploring the world, developing skills, learning various subjects, quantifying personal health.
